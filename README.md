# üìä Data Science & AI Portfolio 

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!  
Here you will find a selection of projects developed as part of my transition towards the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence field, with a particular focus on applying data-driven solutions to **Supply Chain, Operations, and Process Optimization** but focusing as well in other Data Driven areas!

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

My name is Gonzalo and I am a professional with solid experience in **Process Engineering**, **Operations Management**, and **Project Management** within Supply Chain environments. Throughout my career, I have led initiatives linked to process improvement, efficiency optimization, operations management and data analysis. 

Recognizing the growing importance of data-driven decision-making, I am currently undergoing intensive technical training to pivot my career towards Data Science and AI, including:

- Data analysis with **Python** (Pandas, Numpy)  
- Data visualization (**Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**)  
- Machine Learning applied to demand forecasting, inventory management, and process optimization (**Scikit-Learn**)  
- Practical foundations of **Artificial Intelligence**  

I am currently completing:

‚úÖ **Data Analytics Mastery** and **Python Data Science Mastery** programs by Isaac Gonz√°lez (DS4B) 
‚úÖ Preparing for the **Master's in Artificial Intelligence & Big Data** at **ISDI** starting on October 2025

My goal is to integrate my industry experience with technical data skills to help organizations improve processes, optimize operations, and make better data-driven decisions.
